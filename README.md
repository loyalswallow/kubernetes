# CronJob Displaying Time until the Next Job Schedule.
This repository is a fork of the official [Kubernetes repository](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes).

Currently, CronJobs don't show the next scheduled time of jobs. I thought it would be useful if they displayed the remaining time until the next scheduled job.

For detailed instructions, see my [blog posts](https://medium.com/@loyalswallow21/displaying-the-next-schedule-for-kubernetes-cronjobs-a4c7c7592f78)
